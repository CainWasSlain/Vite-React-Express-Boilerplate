# Express Backend

This folder contains the backend server built with **Express.js**, a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework. It provides a robust set of features to build APIs and web servers quickly.

## Overview of the Backend Structure

Here’s a brief explanation of how the main parts of the backend work together:

- **Controllers**  
  Handle incoming HTTP requests, process input, and return responses. They act as the “bridge” between routes and business logic.

- **Services**  
  Contain the core business logic and interact with databases or other APIs. Controllers call services to perform actions.

- **Middleware**  
  Functions that run during the request-response cycle to perform tasks such as authentication, logging, or parsing request bodies before reaching controllers.

- **Routes**  
  Define the API endpoints and map each endpoint to a specific controller function. They organize how the app responds to different HTTP requests.

- **server.js**  
  The main entry point of the backend. It sets up the Express app, connects middleware and routes, and starts the server listening on a specified port.

Together, these parts help keep your backend organized, modular, and easy to maintain.

## Environment Variables

The backend uses environment variables to configure settings like the server port, database connection strings, API keys, and more. These variables are stored in a `.env` file in the backend folder.

You need to create this file by copying from the example `.env` file and update it with your configuration values.

> For more details, please refer to the root README.

## Running the Server

- **Development mode (with hot reload):**  
  Runs the backend with automatic reloads on code changes.

- **Production mode:**  
  Runs the backend server in production. Before running production mode, ensure your frontend is built and properly configured to be served by the backend if applicable.

By default, the server listens on the port specified in your `.env` file or port `5000` if not set.

## API Testing

To test your backend APIs, you can use tools like:

- **[Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/):** A popular and user-friendly API client to send requests and inspect responses.

- **[Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download):** Another powerful alternative for API testing.

These tools let you interact with your server endpoints without building a frontend first, making debugging and development easier.

## Serving the Frontend (Optional)

If your project includes a frontend built with React or another framework, you can configure Express to serve the frontend’s static files in production. This usually involves:

- Building the frontend to generate static assets.
- Configuring Express middleware to serve those files.

Check your backend’s server code for example configurations.
